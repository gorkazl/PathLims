    "From these numbers alone it is very difficult to interpret whether a network is short or long, or whether it shall be considered as an *small-world* network. For a more complete assessment, these values should be compared to the outcome of other networks. However, since the pathlength and efficiency of any network very much dependent on their size (number of nodes) and density (number of edges) a directed comparison across networks are not always informative. Thus, we need to disentangle the contribution of the network’s internal architecture to the pathlength from the incidental influence contributed by the number of nodes and links.\n",

The difference with the limits is that apart from a set of constraints (e.g., the resulting graph needs to have $N$ nodes and $L$ edges) null-modes impose a generative mechanism governing the rules by which the edges are seeded on the graph. Random graphs assume that each edge is planted by choosing two nodes at random, from a probability distribution where each node has a given chance to be chosen. In ring-lattices edges are seeded following a deterministic procedure based on the nearest neighbours.\n",
