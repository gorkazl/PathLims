    "From these numbers alone it is very difficult to interpret whether a network is short or long, or whether it shall be considered as an *small-world* network. For a more complete assessment, these values should be compared to the outcome of other networks. However, since the pathlength and efficiency of any network very much dependent on their size (number of nodes) and density (number of edges) a directed comparison across networks are not always informative. Thus, we need to disentangle the contribution of the network’s internal architecture to the pathlength from the incidental influence contributed by the number of nodes and links.\n",
